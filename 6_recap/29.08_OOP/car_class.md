* **Exercise: Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** ** **Instructions:** *Create a simple exercise to understand the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this exercise, you'll create a `Car` class that represents basic properties and actions of a car. The goal is to create a class, instantiate objects from it, and perform actions on those objects.* **Tasks:** *1. Define a class called `Car`.

2. The `Car` class should have the following attributes:
   - `make` (string) - The make of the car.
   - `model` (string) - The model of the car.
   - `year` (integer) - The manufacturing year of the car.
   - `color` (string) - The color of the car.
   - `is_running` (boolean) - Indicates whether the car is running or not (initially set to `False`).
3. The `Car` class should have the following methods:
   - `start()` - Sets the `is_running` attribute to `True`.
   - `stop()` - Sets the `is_running` attribute to `False`.
   - `get_status()` - Returns a string indicating whether the car is running or not.

* **Exercise: OOP with Lists** ** **Instructions:** *Extend your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating a `Student` class that includes the concept of a student's courses. Each student can enroll in multiple courses. Create methods to manage the enrollment of courses for each student.* **Tasks:** *1. Define a class called `Student`.

2. The `Student` class should have the following attributes:
   - `name` (string) - The name of the student.
   - `age` (integer) - The age of the student.
   - `courses` (list) - A list of courses the student is enrolled in (initially an empty list).
3. The `Student` class should have the following methods:
   - `enroll(course)` - Add a course to the student's `courses` list.
   - `drop(course)` - Remove a course from the student's `courses` list.
   - `list_courses()` - Return a formatted string containing the list of courses the student is enrolled in.
