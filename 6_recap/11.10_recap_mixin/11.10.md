**Mixins******Scenario**: **You have a base class representing a `Book`, but you want to add functionalities to represent the book as a string and to check if the book is a bestseller. 

****Exercise**** :

1. Create a `Book` class with attributes `title` and `sales`.


2. Create a `StringRepresentationMixin` that can represent any class as a string.

3. Create a `BestSellerMixin` that can check if the book sales are above a certain threshold (e.g., 5000 copies).**# Test**

```
book1 = Book("The Great Novel", 12000)
print(book1.as_string())           # Book(title=The Great Novel, sales=12000)
print(book1.is_bestseller())      # True

book2 = Book("A Simple Tale", 3000)
print(book2.as_string())          # Book(title=A Simple Tale, sales=3000)
print(book2.is_bestseller())     # False
```
