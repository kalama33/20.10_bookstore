Exercise: Short Circuit Evaluation in Python

**Problem:**

Short circuit evaluation is a feature in many programming languages, including Python. It allows expressions involving logical operators (`and` and `or`) to be evaluated only as much as necessary to determine the final result. This can lead to more efficient code by avoiding unnecessary evaluations. In this exercise, you will practice short circuit evaluation with Python's logical operators.

Write a Python function `evaluate_expression` that takes two boolean values (`a`, `b`) as arguments and returns the result of the following expression:
```
result = a and b 
```
However, the catch is that the function should also print a message indicating whether short circuit evaluation occurred during the computation.

**Instructions:**
1. Define a function `evaluate_expression(a, b, c)`.
2. Inside the function, use the given expression to compute the result.
3. Print a message indicating whether short circuit evaluation occurred during the computation. If short circuit evaluation happens, print "Short circuit evaluation occurred!".
4. Return the final result.

# Test cases
print(evaluate_expression(True, False))
print(evaluate_expression(False, True))
print(evaluate_expression(False, False))
Do the same for
```

result = a or b
