##Loops

-loops repeat the code 
- the simplest loop in Python I think is the "while" loop while loop is based on a conditional
    -kind of like an "if"
    -the while runs a block of code until the condition
    -let's make an example

- the other kind of loop we will learn today is a "for" loop

- in Python "for" loops go over some kind of sequence 
    - like characters in a string
    - like items in a list
    - so what is a list???

List store multiple items in a single variable
    - The items could be string
    - The items could be numbers
    - List are "indexed"
    - Indexes atart from zero
    - Indexes are zero-based

- When I say "strings are indexed"

- If you want Iterable numbers
    - There is a function for that!

- When I say "ranges are indexed"

- You can have loops inside loops!
