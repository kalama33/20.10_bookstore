## Computers and Numbers

- A little computer science background info

- Decimal numbers
    - Numbers that use the characters 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
    - Also called base 10 numbers
    - Because there are 10 different characters
    - When counting up we reach 9 and want to add one
        - We add an extra 1 in front and start again from 0
        - 9 -> 10
        - Once our second number reaches 9 and want to add one
        - We increment the second number and start again from 0
        - 19 -> 20
        - 99 -> 100

- Hexadecimal numbers
    - Numbers that use the characters 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
    - Also called base 16 numbers
    - When counting up we reach F and want to add one
        - We add an extra 1 in front and start again from 0
        - F -> 10
        - 19 -> 1A
        - 1A -> 1B
        - 1B -> 1C
    - All the way up to FF, which is 255

- Binary Numbers
    - Numbers that use the characters 0,1
    - Also called base 2 numbers
    - Because there are 2 different characters
    - When counting up we reach 1 and want to add one
    - 0, 1, 10


- Computers work in binary
    - This is a simplification
    - Each file is made up of ones and zeroes
    - We call one 1 or 0 a "bit"
    - 8 bits = 8 characters of 1 or 0
    - 8 bits is also called a byte
    - Each file is a list of ones and zeroes

    - Usually we talk about file sizes in "kilobytes" or "megabytes"

- One byte is 8 bits
    - One kilobyte is 1000 bytes (sometimes, depends on who you ask)
    - One kilobyte is 1024 bytes (sometimes, depends on who you ask)

    - One megabyte is 1000 kilobytes (sometimes, depends on who you ask)
    - One megabyte is 1024 kilobytes (sometimes, depends on who you ask)

    - 1000 megabytes is... 1 gigabyte
    - 1000 gigabyes is.... 1 terabyte

- Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Petabyte...
- You probably don't need to care about the details
- If/when you do, you will be much more advanced

- Oh yeah, this was a Python course, right?

## Conditionals

- What are conditionals?
    - If
    - Else
    - Things depending on other things
    - A situation with different possible results
    - Conditions are verifying a condition

- LETS CODE!
