class Person:

class Employee(.....):
......


# Create an instance of the Employee class
employee = Employee()

# Set the name, age, and salary using the appropriate methods
employee.set_name("John Doe")
employee.set_age(30)
employee.set_salary(5000)

# Get the name, age, and salary using the appropriate methods
print("Employee Name:", employee.get_name()) #---> John Doe
print("Employee Age:", employee.get_age())  #---> 30
print("Employee Salary:", employee.get_salary())  #---> 5000
employee.print_name() #--> John Doe
