**Exercise: Creating a Product Database*** **Objective:** *
Practice working with APIs, SQLite databases, and generating random datetimes by creating a script that fetches product data from an API, generates random datetimes, and stores the information in an SQLite database.* **Instructions:** *1. * **Setup:** *

- Install the `requests` library if you haven't already: `pip install requests`2. * **Task:** *
- Write a Python script that fetches product data from the "Fake Store API" using the `requests` library for a range of product IDs (e.g., from 1 to 10).
- For each product fetched, generate a random datetime within the past year and store the product data (title, category, price, description, and generated datetime) in an SQLite database.3. * **Implementation:** *
- Define a function `fetch_product_data(product_id)` that fetches product data for a given product ID from the API. Handle both successful and failed requests.
- Create an SQLite database named `'products.db'`.
- Define a function `create_products_table(cursor)` that creates a `products` table with columns for product information (title, category, price, description) and a `date_added` column for the generated datetimes.
- Define a function `insert_product_into_db(cursor, product_data)` that inserts a product's data along with a generated datetime into the `products` table.
- In the `__main__` section, use the defined functions to fetch product data, generate random datetimes, and store the information in the database.
- Print a message indicating the success or failure of data retrieval and insertion.4. * **Challenge:** *
- Modify the script to prompt the user for the range of product IDs they want to fetch and store.
- Enhance the script to calculate and store the total cost of each product (price multiplied by quantity) in the database.
