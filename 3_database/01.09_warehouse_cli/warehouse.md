**Exercise: Warehouse Command-Line Interface*** **Objective:** *
Practice working with SQLite databases, creating a command-line interface (CLI), and retrieving data to display to users by building a Warehouse CLI that connects to a product database.* **Instructions:** *1. * **Setup:** *

- Ensure you have the `products.db` SQLite database file with product data stored.2. * **Task:** *
- Write a Python script that establishes a connection to the `products.db` database.
- Implement a function `display_items(cursor)` that queries and displays all product items from the database.
- Create a `main()` function that runs a loop for user interaction. The loop should:
  - Display a menu with the following options:
    - Display Items
    - Exit
  - Prompt the user to select an option.
  - If the user selects "Display Items," call the `display_items` function to show the products.
  - If the user selects "Exit," break the loop and print "Goodbye!"3. * **Implementation:** *
- Start by importing the necessary libraries (e.g., `sqlite3`).
- Establish a connection to the `products.db` SQLite database.
- Define the `display_items(cursor)` function that queries the `products` table and displays product information.
- Define the `main()` function that contains a loop for user interaction. Inside the loop, display the menu and perform the selected action based on user input.
- Close the database connection when exiting the program.
